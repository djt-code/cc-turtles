-- farm.lua -- crop farming turtle for CC:Tweaked (wheat, carrots,
-- potatoes, beetroot and sugar cane; any mix of them on one farm)
--
-- Needs a diamond hoe (and a diamond pickaxe for `clone`), equipped or in
-- the inventory.  The program makes the tool it needs the only tool
-- equipped and parks the other in the inventory, so digDown() with the hoe
-- always tills.  Optional: Advanced Peripherals Chunky Turtle upgrade.
--
-- Usage:
--   farm <width> <length> [repeatMinutes]         first run: explore + farm
--   farm [repeatMinutes]                           later runs: saved layout
--   farm learn <width> <length> [repeatMinutes]    re-explore the farm
--   farm repair                                    inspect every tile once and
--                                                  fix damage, then stop
--   farm clone [repeatMinutes]                     build the saved layout HERE,
--                                                  then farm it
--   farm reset                                     return to home after a stop
--   farm reset --here                              turtle is home already (moved
--                                                  by hand): just reset position
--   farm ... --here                                accept current spot as home
--
-- width  = tiles to the RIGHT of the turtle (negative = to the LEFT)
-- length = tiles AHEAD of the turtle (negative = BEHIND)
-- Both are counted OUT from the turtle: its own row and column are not part
-- of the farm, so the box is x = 1..width, z = 1..length.
-- repeatMinutes defaults to 20; 0 = single pass.
--
-- Placement: put the turtle diagonally outside one corner of the farm,
-- hovering TWO blocks above the farmland (one block above the crop tops).
-- Put the output chest/barrel directly below the start position (up to 3
-- blocks down, air between; it's found afresh on every visit, so it can be
-- moved up or down later without telling the turtle).  Keep in the chest: what each crop is planted with (wheat
-- or beetroot seeds, carrots, potatoes, sugar cane), dirt, and a bucket or
-- two (water buckets for clone); the turtle restocks from it.
--
-- How it works:
--  * Learning pass: only records the layout; it changes nothing.  Flies
--    over every tile in the box.  A crop below -> crop tile.  Air below ->
--    drops down a block to look at the ground: farmland -> crop tile;
--    water -> lane; other -> left alone.  Missing ground and bare dirt
--    could be either, so they take the kind of the strip they lie in
--    (bare dirt outside any strip is farmed).  Saved to farm.map, which
--    from then on is the farm as it SHOULD be.
--  * Farming pass: serpentines over the crop tiles only, line by line
--    along the lanes, each line from the end nearest the last, lanes
--    skipped.  Untilled dirt is tilled and planted on the way.  Ground
--    missing under a crop tile, or a block in the way, is damage: after
--    the pass the turtle goes home and runs a full repair pass.
--  * Full repair pass (also `farm repair`, and once after clone):
--    inspects every crop tile and dips to crop level over every lane
--    tile to check its water, then rebuilds damaged tiles to match the
--    layout.  Land: dirt, till, plant.  Lane: dirt floor beneath if
--    missing, dirt walls on every side that isn't lane, then water.
--    After learning there's no inspection: learning saw every tile, so
--    just the gaps it found (missing ground, lane water that isn't a
--    source) are rebuilt, and only if there are any.
--  * Clone: builds farm.map at the current position.  Phase 1 (pickaxe)
--    clears the crop level, digs lane trenches and removes stone where
--    land is wanted.  Phase 2 (hoe) fills/tills/plants land, then floors,
--    walls and waters the lanes.  Each lane is bootstrapped with two water
--    buckets at tiles 1 and 3 (tile 2 becomes a source on its own) and the
--    rest is scooped from that regenerating tile.
--  * Crops: learning notes which crop grows on each tile; bare farmland
--    gets the crop most of its strip grows.  The farming pass harvests
--    each crop when ripe (age 7; beetroot 3) and replants the crop the
--    plan wants there (a different crop found growing is harvested when
--    ripe and replaced), and plants bare farmland (tilling through the
--    air gap if it reverted to dirt).  Back home it drops produce,
--    restocks, repairs if needed, composts surplus seeds, runs grow
--    passes when the chest has bone meal to spare, and sleeps.
--  * Sugar cane: grows on dirt, sand, moss, mud and the like, beside a
--    water source, up to 3 high from cruise height upwards, so on a farm
--    with cane the turtle travels at CANE_TRAVEL_Y (learning always does).
--    Cane is worked from one above cruise height: a third block is cut on
--    the way in and the second from above, so every cut block lands in
--    the inventory; the bottom block is never cut, since that is what
--    regrows.  A missing bottom block is replanted with cane; if it won't
--    take (no ground, or no water beside it) that's damage, and the full
--    repair pass rebuilds the lane first, then the cane.
--  * Navigation is at a fixed cruise height (turtlelib.stepFlat) with a
--    learned obstacle map and BFS re-routing.  Position is saved to disk
--    after every move so `farm reset` can bring it home after a Ctrl+T.
