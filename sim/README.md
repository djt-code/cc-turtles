# Simulators

Offline tests for the turtle programs. Each `.lua` file here is a
scenario: it sets up one of the mock worlds in `lib/`, runs the real
program from the repo (`turtle/`, `bin/`, `pc/`), and prints the program's output plus a summary
of the world afterwards (lanes, crops, chest contents, moves). The mocks
replace the CC:Tweaked APIs the programs use (`turtle`, `peripheral`,
`fs`, `sleep`, `os.pullEvent`, ...) around a small block world in memory;
nothing is written to disk.

```
pip install lupa
python sim/run.py                  # all of them, then an ok/ERROR summary
python sim/run.py farm_clone       # by name, ".lua" optional
python sim/run.py --check          # syntax-check the programs and these files
```

`--check` also counts locals as CC's Lua does (`locals.py`): no function
may have more than 200 in scope, counting those of the functions around
it, so a big program's top-level locals use up the allowance of every
function inside it. Standard Lua counts each function on its own, so the
simulators never hit this; on a turtle the program won't load. It warns
within 15 of the limit. `mine.lua` and `farm.lua` stay far under it by
defining their top-level names in a private `_ENV` table instead of
locals (see the README's Library section).

The help files in `help/` are made from each program's top comment by
`python sim/mkhelp.py`; `--check` fails if one is out of date, so change
the comment and run it again rather than editing `help/`. Topics that
aren't a program's (`help network`) are written by hand in `doc/<topic>.txt`
and copied in as they are.

Or on a ComputerCraft computer or turtle, no Python needed. A clone
leaves sim/ out, so name what the simulators need:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djt-code/cc-turtles/main/bin/git.lua /git-boot.lua
git-boot clone https://github.com/djt-code/cc-turtles /cc-turtles --only sim/ --only turtle/ --only bin/ --only lib/
rm git-boot.lua
cd /cc-turtles
```

That's about 890 KB, and the logs of a full run another 140 KB, more than
CC's default 1 MB disk: raise `computer_space_limit` in the server's
`computercraft-server.toml`, or take just what the watched ones need
(about 670 KB): `--only sim/ --only turtle/turtlelib.lua --only
turtle/farm.lua --only turtle/mine.lua --only bin/git.lua`.
`bin/git pull` updates it.

```
sim/runsim                         # all of them, then a summary
sim/runsim farm_clone              # by name
sim/runsim --list                  # what there is
```

`runsim` runs each simulator in a sandbox (`lib/sandbox.lua`: its own globals, its own `os`,
its own `loadfile`/`require`), so the mocks never touch the real computer,
and yields about once a second so CC doesn't stop it for running too long
without yielding. Full output goes to `sim/logs/<name>.log`; the screen
scrolls it past as it runs. Ctrl+T stops it.

## Watching one on a monitor

`sim/watchsim <name>` plays a simulator out move by move on an attached
monitor:

- for a farm, a **top-down view** of it (+z up the screen, +x to the
  right), the turtle as a yellow arrow;
- for the mine (`mine_tunnel`), a **plan** instead: a level slice through
  the rock at the turtle's height, so you see the tunnel open up lane by
  lane and the turtle wander off into ore veins;
- a **side view**, a slice through the turtle's current x (z across, y up),
  so you see it dip into lanes, dig and climb. For the mine, both views
  follow the turtle along the tunnel;
- the move count, position, facing and fuel, and the program's own messages
  as it prints them. The computer's screen shows the simulator's report.

Keys on the computer: **space** pause/resume (or tap the monitor),
**right** one move while paused, **up/down** faster/slower (from 1 s down
to one move per tick), **f** skip to the end of the current farm run,
**q** quit. `sim/watchsim` on its own lists the simulators it can show
(the farm ones and `mine_tunnel`; the others have no world to draw).

What to build:

- An **Advanced Computer** (or advanced turtle) with the simulators on it
  (the clone above, which needs HTTP enabled on the server).
- An **Advanced Monitor** wall: plain monitors have no colour, and the
  views rely on it. Monitors join into one screen when placed edge to edge
  in a flat rectangle. Size it for the largest farm you'll watch (the
  viewer runs at text scale 0.5):

  | Simulators | Needs (characters) | Smallest monitor |
  |---|---|---|
  | `farm_reset` (5x22) | 65x27 | 4 wide x 3 tall |
  | `farm_clone`, `farm_clone_lane_fallback`, `farm_fuel` (7x16) | 57x21 | 3 wide x 2 tall |
  | `farm_pass_moves` (9x8) | 45x15 | 3 wide x 2 tall |
  | every other `farm_*` (5x6) | 33x15 | 2 wide x 2 tall |
  | `mine_tunnel` (follows the turtle) | 51x20 | 3 wide x 2 tall |

  **4x3 (78x38) shows all of them, with room for plenty of the
  messages; 3x2 shows all but `farm_reset`.** The mine's views grow with
  the monitor: a bigger one shows more of the tunnel at once. A monitor that's too small gets a message naming the
  size to build.
- Put the monitor against any side of the computer, or connect it with
  wired modems (right-click each modem to connect it). With more than one
  monitor attached, name the one to use: `sim/watchsim farm_clone
  monitor_0`.

What the colours mean: in the mine, `##` rock in its own shade (stone,
deepslate, andesite, diorite, granite, tuff), ores by symbol on the
metal's colour (`Fe` iron, `Au` gold, `Di` diamond, `Em` emerald, `Co`
coal, `La` lapis, `Rs` redstone, `Cu` copper, `**` a modded ore), red on
orange `~~` lava, `..` gravel, `BB` bedrock, yellow `!!` torch, black
open space. On a farm:
blue `~~` water source, light blue `~n` flowing
water, brown `::` farmland, brown dirt, green grass, crops as letter and
age (`w3` wheat at stage 3) on green, lime once ripe, `||` sugar cane,
`..` sand, orange `[]` chest, gray `\/` hopper, gray `##` stone, yellow
the turtle (`^^ >> vv <<` top-down; `>> <<` along z or `+x -x` across, side
on).

A simulator counts as failing if the program raised an error (`ERROR:` in
its output), it crashed, or (with `run.py`) it ran past 5 minutes. Everything
else is for
reading: compare the numbers before and after a change (`git stash`, run,
`git stash pop`, run).

| Simulator | Program | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `farm_repair` | farm | learn with existing damage; holes, dry/flowing lane water, dirt in a lane, a block over a lane, untilled dirt; what a farming pass fixes vs. what triggers a full repair; `farm repair` |
| `farm_full_chest` | farm | a turtle full of coal, a nearly full chest, a full chest: nothing spills, the turtle waits for room |
| `farm_mixed_crops` | farm | wheat, carrots, potatoes and beetroot learned per tile; a wrong crop planted on a tile |
| `farm_reset` | farm | `farm reset` after a stop out on a 5x22 farm with cane: past the default routing area, over cane, down in a lane, at travel height, with no map yet, left of home; facing other than saved, at home and mid-farm, and a farming run started at home facing the wrong way |
| `farm_sugar_cane` | farm | a cane strip: harvest above the bottom block, replant a cane lost when its lane dried up |
| `farm_bone_meal` | farm | grow passes with bone meal from the chest |
| `farm_compost_while_waiting` | farm | surplus seeds go into the compost hopper during the wait between runs; a short wait runs out of time |
| `farm_chest_tidy` | farm | the farm chest tidied on every visit: part stacks merged, then sorted with like items together at the end of the chest (slot 1 left free); no moves when already in order; a full chest |
| `farm_clone` | farm | `farm clone` of a 7x16 farm with two lanes; moves, buckets scooped/poured, lane tiles that aren't sources |
| `farm_clone_lane_fallback` | farm | as `farm_clone`, but two lane tiles never fill on their own and must be poured |
| `farm_fuel` | farm | real fuel levels: learn and clone starting nearly empty with little coal in the chest; trips home to refuel and back, waiting at home for the "player" to add coal; never a move on an empty tank; a farming pass 5 min apart that waits longer than that for fuel starts over, a short wait carries on |
| `farm_pass_moves` | farm | moves for one plain farming pass on a 9x8 farm (`ALONGX=1`: lane along x) |
| `mine_tunnel` | mine | tunnels through mixed rock: veins out of the walls, floor and ceiling (part of one beyond reach), ore inside the tunnel, a tag-only modded ore, lava, falling gravel, a floor solid all along (the hole floor ore leaves filled); a crevasse across the tunnel bridged; torches in wall niches with no floor block dark enough for mobs (one wall, both walls for a tunnel 10 wide, one at the end of a short tunnel, a niche opening into a cave given a block to stand the torch on); `--no-lights` leaving the torches in the chest; a Geo Scanner swapped in for the pickaxe beside a chunk controller (the scan lined up with the tunnel though the mock reports along world axes turned from it, ore 5-6 out fetched, a diamond 8 out mined and its vein followed on past the scan, gold 8 out left, a fifth of the turns; a field of small deposits off one wall fetched one after another, not back to the tunnel between each); water that flows back as in the game: a tunnel through an underground lake and under one above its ceiling left dry and sealed off, without going round in circles placing blocks, and with little fuel going for coal as soon as a scan finds it; homes every 16 with supplies carried forward, room left above each valuables chest, and valuables collected on the way back, picked-up items joining their stacks (the mock stores them as the game does); a tunnel with no length that runs out of chests, then `--resume` (twice, the second time with more valuables in a home than it can carry: the most valuable come back); bedrock; running short of fuel (gets back with its margin); `mine reset` from inside a vein; `mine reset` to the last home (and `--to-start`) with a wrong saved heading (corrected from the tunnel's walls; where it can't tell, stopped on finding no home chests); with a crafting table and few chests, wood sought like coal (a line of logs out of the wall followed past an ordinary vein's reach; with a scanner, logs that don't touch the tunnel fetched), and not sought without a table or with chests enough; resumed from the start through a lit tunnel flooded from a hole in the ceiling out of sight of the home's lane: the hole found and sealed on the way out, and the missing and washed-away torches put back once the water's gone; the same walk through a dry tunnel leaving the torches that are up alone (the mock names a torch hung on a wall `wall_torch`, as the game does) and moving bulk in home 1's valuables chest down to its bulk chest; `mine haul` bringing back what one trip couldn't, with no bulk carried to the start or swapped into a valuables chest to make room, and bulk found in a valuables chest moved down to its bulk chest; `mine reset` to the last home from inside the tunnel and `--resume` from there; the last home and its segment flooded: `mine reset --home 1` back a home and `--resume` drying the segment out and going on past home 2 without building it again (fetching fuel from home 2 first, with little in the tank); water standing behind the home not taken for a wrong scan heading, and a scan really turned from the heading skipped; water from a source in the wall spread along the tunnel floor followed upstream and sealed; stopped (as if by Ctrl+T) partway through a segment and resumed from its log, without going over the finished lanes again; then the same with a hole in the ceiling letting water in meanwhile, which the resume follows up to and seals, putting back the torches it washed away; and stopped before the middle column's floor is dug, with lichen leaking into the finished side column, which the resume goes over instead; waterlogged glow lichen in the walls and ceiling with water behind it, and dry lichen, all replaced so no water gets in (with and without a scanner); a segment dug already with lichen leaking water along its floor, gone over from the home before and the lichen found and replaced, and the same with lichen in the ceiling at the far end, its water falling and spreading back along the floor; an aquifer beside the tunnel at every height: no water past the block being dug and no torch washed away (with and without a scanner). Water flows with the game's timing: it reacts 5 ticks after a change next to it, each turtle action takes 8, a turtle pushes flowing water out of the block it moves into, and torches it reaches are washed away; a tunnel to the left and down; a mineshaft: a chest minecart standing where home 1's wall chest goes broken and picked up with what it spills (placing a chest at it only right-clicks it, as in game), rails taken from the tunnel and its floor, and, low on chests and torches, chests and torches crafted from oak logs and mined planks with a crafting table swapped in for the pickaxe, the wood and table carried forward to the last home and none of it burnt |
| `turtlelib_stop` | turtlelib | Ctrl+T during a turn: without `T.run` the saved heading is a turn behind; with it the program stops once the turn is saved |
| `turtlelib_restock` | turtlelib | `T.restockFrom` reaching items behind other stacks in a chest |
| `turtlelib_refuel` | turtlelib | `T.refuelTo` and `T.totalFuelAvailable` burn and count only `T.fuel` items, never the wood and chests on board |
| `autostart_boot` | autostart | `turtle/autostart.lua` at boot: for each program it can start, what it runs from the job's files and the saved position (resume a tunnel it went down in, from the last home; leave a finished or self-stopped one; start one from the settings; farm reset then farm; learn from the settings' size; mow only when cut short or on repeat), a key cancelling, --now, a failed step stopping the rest |
| `git_space` | git | `bin/git.lua` against a mock GitHub and a small disk: a clone leaving out `sim/` and the other device's folder (`--all`, `--skip`), a disk that fills mid-clone and `git pull` finishing it, a checkout from before the device rule losing `sim/`, files moving between folders on a nearly full disk |
| `turtlelib_datapath` | turtlelib | `T.dataPath` moving a job's file left in the repo's top folder (from before `turtle/`) down next to the program, and nothing else |
| `pager` | pager, more, cat | on the turtle's 39 x 13 screen with scripted keys: what fits is printed, 12 lines and a status line, every paging, line and sideways key, no wrapping, `q` leaving the next key for the shell, `more` over several files with headers and a missing one, `more` into a pipe copying like `cat`, `cat`'s plain output |

| `coreutils_ls` | ls | hidden files left out and shown (`-a`, `-A`), `-l` and `-lah` (total line, mode, sizes like 4.9K, times; no `w` on `/rom`), `-t -S -r -F -d -R`, file operands before directories with headers, columns to the screen and one per line into a pipe, a missing operand (status 2), a bad option, `ls` at the prompt running CraftOS's `list` until install's alias makes it ours, and, with the fileserver's pool mounted, its member disks' mounts hidden from `ls` (shown with `-a`) and from Craftix's `*` (matched by `d*`) |
| `coreutils_fs` | df, du, find | `df` and `df -P` over the root and `/rom`, `du -a -s -k`, `find`'s expression grammar and primaries, globs with ranges and classes, `-prune`, `-xdev`, `-exec ;` and `+`, `-ok` from a pipe, a 450-file tree that yields |

| `claude_drive` | claude | against a scripted API (canned replies, no network): the request shape, tool results going back, the Lua sandbox (no `fs`/`http`/`shell`, errors as error results, definitions persisting), retries and refusals, the step budget, `--confirm`, `ask_user`, a second goal, no key |
| `autocompost_with_chest` | autocompost | composts what it can, rejects the rest into the chest in front |
| `autocompost_no_chest` | autocompost | no chest and a backed-up composter: ends idle instead of spinning |
| `net_stack` | net (lib/net.lua) | stacks on several computers over mock modem wires (each frame copied, as CC does), a router between two networks and VLAN 20 on one wire: ARP, UDP on a segment and through the router and back, tables carried, ping with the TTL one less, no ARP answer (host unreachable after 3 tries), no route at the router (net unreachable from it), a routing loop between two routers (time exceeded), traceroute's TTLs, broadcasts kept to their segment and VLAN, a VLAN reaching the untagged network only through the router's trunk, a closed port, loopback, frames for other MACs ignored, the `os.pullEventRaw` hook handling a frame once however many coroutines see it, the settings; TCP: the handshake and the header's fields, bytes both ways in segments of at most 536, a lost segment and a lost ACK (sent again, taken once), out of order (dropped, then go back N), the receive window filling and opening, keepalive on an idle connection, an orderly close each side in turn (CLOSE_WAIT, FIN_WAIT_2, TIME_WAIT), refused, reset by a side that forgot it, lost when nothing gets through, timed out connecting, sequence numbers wrapping at 2^32, abort, and loopback |
| `telnet` | telnet (lib/telnet.lua) | the Telnet parser (data, IAC IAC, options, NAWS, IP, a command split across reads, 255 in a subnegotiation); the renderer (the whole screen first, xterm 256 colours, UTF-8, the cursor; nothing when nothing changed; one changed row alone); the client's terminal fed that, showing the same text and colours (Latin-1, block graphics) and cursor, an inverted sextant as its complement with colours swapped, 16-colour and true-colour SGR, CR LF and erase to end of line, greys without colour; the decoder (characters with their keys, Enter from CR, LF, CR LF or CR NUL once, arrows, Delete, Page Down, both Homes, Backspace, Tab, Ctrl+letter, Ctrl+T, bracketed paste across reads, SGR mouse clicks, drags and the wheel); the client's keys and mouse decoded back |

| `net_tools` | ip, ping, traceroute, nc | in a shellworld against stacks that answer at once: `ip addr`/`route`/`host`/`link` kept in settings and shown down and up, `ip up` opening the channels (VLANs too) and `ip down` closing them; `ping` by name through a router (replies, TTL, summary), with `-t 1` (time exceeded), to a network nobody routes (net unreachable), an unknown host, the network down; `traceroute` (the router, then the host; `!N`); `nc -u -l -v` printing datagrams and tables; `nc` over TCP to a listening stack (the line sent, the answer printed without `\r`, both sides closed), `nc -l -v` taking one connection, and a refused port |
| `fileserver_jbod` | fileserver (lib/jbod) | a mock file system with a 125 KB floppy in each of several drives: blank disks joining by themselves, `/jbod` in the root listing, capacity and free space added up, shared folders, a 300 KB file split across three disks and read back the same, out of space as an error with nothing half written, a fifth drive growing the pool, a disk with files waiting for `add`, copy and move in and out, `fs.find`, a disk with part of a split file taken out and put back, deleting every part, append |
| `diskclone_disks` | diskclone | blank, labelled and non-empty disks, `--force`, a too-small disk, a disk already in the drive, no `LABEL` file |

## The library

The mocks live in `lib/`, apart from the scenarios:

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `lib/mock.lua` | The pieces every world is built from: the turtle's inventory stored as the game stores it (a pickup goes into the first slot from the selected one that is empty or matches; `SPLIT` counts second stacks it starts, `SPILLED` what didn't fit), containers (drop merges first, suck takes the first stack, `pushItems`), moving and turning with fuel (`FUEL`, `LOWEST`, `DRY`), looking, acting each way, upgrades (`EQ`), `fs` over a table of files, print capture, the `==` report line (`M.runner`) and `M.check`; also `textutils` JSON, a scripted `http` (`M.httpApi`: canned replies off a queue, every request kept), a scripted keyboard (`M.consoleApi`) and a screen (`M.termApi`: `term` drawing into rows of text, `os.pullEvent` taking scripted key events). |
| `lib/farmworld.lua` | A farm for farm.lua: `F.build{width, length, lanes, crops}` lays out strips of crops or `"cane"` between water lanes over a dirt floor, with the chest under home; the hoe harvests, cuts cane and tills through the gap; seeds, bone meal, dirt, water buckets and empty buckets place as in the game; water at lane level follows the infinite-source rule (`F.STUCK` keeps a cell from refilling); a hopper behind home takes compost; `sleep` runs the clock (`CLOCK`, `STOP_AT`). `F.stock`, `F.ripen`, `F.show`, `F.chestLine`, `F.cropCount`, `F.badLaneTiles`, `F.caneHeights` for scenarios. |
| `lib/mineworld.lua` | Rock for mine.lua: mixed stone wherever nothing is set, chests, ore (`Mine.features` for the standard veins, lava and gravel), falling gravel, water that flows with the game's timing (`WATERY`), a Geo Scanner (`SCANNER`, `SCAN_TURN`, `WORLD_COORDS`), minecarts (`Mine.ENTITIES`; what they spill lies in `Mine.GROUND`), a crafting table that crafts the recipes mine.lua uses (`CRAFTED`), wood and chests that burn as in game (`BURNT`), and the checks: `leftIn`, `checkFloor`, `checkLight`, `checkOres`, `checkLava`, `checkStart`, `checkHomes`, `wetIn`, `torchesIn`. `STOP_AT_DIG` stops a run as Ctrl+T would. |
| `lib/composter.lua` | A turtle on a composter for autocompost.lua: the composter, the hopper under it (`HOPPER_STOPS_AT` backs it up) and an optional chest in front. |
| `lib/shellworld.lua` | A CraftOS computer for the utilities: `SW.new(PROJ)` gives an in-memory file system (directories, a read-only `/rom` with stubs of the stock programs, the repo's programs copied into `/cc-turtles/bin` (or `lib/`, `turtle/`, `pc/`, as in the repo) as they run; `/cc-turtles/bin` and `/cc-turtles/turtle` on the path), the stock shell's path, aliases and word splitting, `io`, `term`, `os`, `printError`. `W:file`, `W:dir`, `W:read` set and read files; `W:run(prog, args..., opts)` runs a program, `W:sh(line)` a command line as typed, `W:call(fn)` code inside the world; each gives `r.out`, `r.err`, `r.status`, `r.ok`. Standard input is typed lines (`stdin`, then Ctrl+T) or a pipe (`pipe`, `pipeIn`, `pipeOut`); `events` and `onPull` script `os.pullEvent`. `print`, `write`, `printError` and `read` are in `_G` while a run goes on (so a shell can swap them, as on CraftOS), `term.redirect` works, and `W.yieldEvents` makes `os.pullEvent` inside a coroutine yield as the real one does. |
| `lib/sandbox.lua` | What `runsim` and `watchsim` run a simulator in on a CC computer. |

Each world is a module (`local F = require("farmworld")`) that installs the
mocked globals when loaded and returns its state: `F.inv` (the turtle's
slots), `F.chest`, `F.files`, `F.P` (where it is and faces), `F.moves`,
`F.get`/`F.set` for blocks. Knobs and counters the scenarios set and read
(`FUEL`, `EQ`, `WATERY`, `SPILLED`, ...) are globals, listed at the top of
each file. A scenario builds a world, puts things in it, runs the program
(`F.runner(PROJ)` gives the `run(...)` that prints the `==` line) and
prints or checks what came of it; `turtlelib_stop` and `diskclone_disks`
need no world and carry their own small mocks.

All the farm scenarios share one layout: home at `(0,0,0)` facing `+z`,
