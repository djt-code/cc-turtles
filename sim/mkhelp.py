"""Make help/<name>.txt for each program from the comment at its top.

    python sim/mkhelp.py            write help/
    python sim/mkhelp.py --check    say which help files are out of date

CraftOS's `help` wraps each line to the screen, so prose is joined into
one line per paragraph (it reflows on a 39-column turtle); indented lines
(usage) are kept as they are; a table of "command  what it does" rows
becomes each command on its line and what it does on the next, and a
"* " bullet's or a "name = ..." definition's lines are joined.  The header
stops at a "How it works" section, which is about the code, not its use.
help/cc-turtles.txt lists every command, and the topics: hand-written
help in doc/<topic>.txt (a guide, not a program's), copied as it is.
