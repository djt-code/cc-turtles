-- mine.lua -- tunnel-mining turtle for CC:Tweaked
--
-- Needs a pickaxe (any *_pickaxe upgrade), equipped or in the inventory.
-- Any other tool is parked in the inventory while it runs and put back
-- afterwards.  Optional: Advanced Peripherals Chunky Turtle upgrade so it
-- keeps running unattended.
--
-- Usage:  mine [<width> <height> [length]] [--spacing N] [--no-lights] [--here]
--         mine --resume          keep digging the tunnel it stopped in (from
--                                the start, or from the last home)
--         mine ... --new         start a fresh tunnel, forgetting the old one
--         mine haul              shuttle the valuables in the homes back to
--                                the start, as many trips as it takes
--         mine reset             back to the last home it built, after a
--                                Ctrl+T or restart
--         mine reset --to-start  back to the start instead
--         mine reset --here      turtle was put back at the start by hand
--
-- width  = blocks to the RIGHT of the turtle (negative = to the LEFT)
-- height = blocks UP from the turtle (negative = DOWN)
-- length = blocks the tunnel runs ahead; leave it out to keep going until
--          the turtle can't (out of chests or fuel, a full chest, bedrock)
--
-- With no size, it digs the one in the settings: 3x3, 32 long unless
-- changed (`set mine.width 5`, `set mine.length 0` for no end; also
-- mine.height, mine.spacing, mine.lights).  A size given here is saved
-- there, so the next `mine` (or the autostart) digs the same.
--
-- The turtle's own column and row are part of the tunnel: it stands in
-- the mouth at one bottom (or top, for negative heights) corner, and the
-- tunnel starts with the block in front of it.  `mine 3 3 32` digs a 3x3
-- tunnel 32 long, up and to the right of the turtle.
--
-- Placement: put the turtle where the tunnel's corner should start,
-- facing along it.  Put a chest directly ABOVE the start for valuables and
-- one directly BELOW it for bulk (stone, cobblestone, deepslate, dirt,
-- gravel, sand...).  Stock the top chest with fuel and with CHESTS: the
-- turtle builds a new home out of two of them every `spacing` blocks.
-- Torches in it too, and it lights the tunnel (unless --no-lights).  And a
-- crafting table, so it can craft more chests and torches from wood it
-- finds (see Crafting below).
--
-- How it works:
--  * Homes: the tunnel is dug a segment at a time.  At the end of each
--    segment the turtle builds a home there: a chest set into the wall
--    beside its start column (valuables and supplies) and one under the
--    floor (bulk; over the ceiling for a downward tunnel).  Spacing is
--    chosen so a segment's bulk fits in its home's chest (at most 64), and
--    trips to unload or refuel only ever go back to the nearest home.
--  * Supplies move forward: building a home, the turtle carries the spare
--    chests, the fuel, the torches, all the wood it has mined (logs,
--    planks, sticks) and the crafting table from the old home to the new
--    one, as many trips as it takes.  Bulk stays in the home it was mined
--    near (bulk only ever goes in bulk chests): walking back, it leaves
--    the bulk it carries at each home it passes, keeping a stack of
--    filler for water on the way until home 1, so none reaches the start;
--    bulk found in a valuables chest goes down into the bulk chest.
--    Valuables stay in their home's chest until the end.  It checks
--    each chest it places is really there: in a mineshaft, a minecart
--    standing where a chest goes is broken and picked up first.
--  * Crafting: at the newest home, when it has fewer chests than two more
--    homes take, or fewer torches than two segments do, it crafts its wood
--    into as many chests as it can, keeping back planks for the torches
--    those homes' segments need, and crafts the torches from coal it can
--    spare.  It swaps the crafting table in for the pickaxe to craft, and
--    empties its inventory into the home's chests for it (a turtle crafts
--    from its inventory); then everything goes back.  No table: it says
--    so, and stops when it's out of chests.
--  * Seeking wood: with a crafting table (on board, equipped, or in its
--    working home), while the wood and chests at its working home and on
--    board would build fewer than WOOD_HOMES (8) more homes, it treats
--    logs and planks (mineshafts) like coal: one it touches is followed
--    to the end of its run, and with a Geo Scanner one a scan shows is
--    fetched from anywhere in the scan.  It notes what its working home
--    holds each time it's there.
--  * Stopping: out of chests for the next home, not enough fuel to go on
--    and still get back, a home chest full or missing, or something it
--    can't dig through.  Then (or once the tunnel is as long as asked) it
--    walks back to the start, collecting the valuables from every home on
--    the way, the most valuable first when it can't carry them all, and
--    leaves them in the top chest at the start.  Supplies stay in the last
--    home, so `mine --resume` can carry on from there (bringing any new
--    chests and fuel from the start's top chest with it).  On that walk
--    out it goes over each segment as when resuming from an earlier home:
--    along the floor by the lit wall, putting back any torch that's
--    missing (one that's there, a wall torch as the game calls it once
--    hung, is left alone), and following any water it meets to where it
--    gets in and sealing that (then lighting what the water kept dark);
--    at each home it moves any bulk in the valuables chest down into the
--    bulk chest.
--  * Fuel: the tank always keeps enough to get back to the start; the
--    turtle refuels from each home's chest, and coal it mines lands there.
--    It only burns coal, charcoal and the like, never wood or chests.
--  * Mineshafts: rails in the tunnel, its walls or floor are dug out (and
--    the wall or floor filled), and minecarts in its way broken; both are
--    valuables, brought back to the start.
--  * Lanes: each segment is mined in lanes running along it, one per row
--    in the side columns and every third row (plus the top and bottom ones)
--    in the middle columns, digging the rows in between up and down.  So
--    the turtle touches every block of the walls, floor and ceiling, and
--    looks at each one.
--  * Geo Scanner (Advanced Peripherals): put one in the start's top chest
--    and the turtle takes it along and uses it: every 15 blocks along a
--    segment it swaps the scanner in for its pickaxe (a chunk controller
--    on the other side stays put), scans (radius 8, no fuel), and swaps
--    back.  It only turns to look at wall blocks the scan says are ore,
--    lava or water, and right after each scan it tunnels out to the ore it
--    found, up to SCAN_REACH (6) from the tunnel, and diamonds and coal
--    however far out as long as the scan saw them, then goes on with the
--    tunnel.  It goes no further than the scan reached, except to follow a
--    diamond or coal vein to its end.  Low on fuel, it fetches the coal first.  See the Geo Scanner section for how it lines the
--    scan's world directions up with the tunnel.
--  * Veins: an ore it touches (anything tagged as an ore, *_ore blocks,
--    ancient debris) is mined along with its whole vein: the turtle
--    follows it block by block, looking all round each one, up to
--    VEIN_REACH blocks out from the tunnel, never back past the start.
--  * Lava and water touching the tunnel or a vein are sealed with a bulk
--    block, and so is anything that lets them through: waterlogged blocks
--    (glow lichen, dripstone... with water in them, which look like blocks
--    but are water sources), water plants, and thin things that aren't
--    solid (lichen, vines, grass) in the walls, floor or ceiling: those are
--    dug out first.  The bulk comes from the inventory (it keeps a stack
--    for this).  Turtles take
--    no harm from lava, but lava burns any item that falls in it and
--    makes the tunnel deadly for players.  Lava or water inside the
--    tunnel is dried out (see dry): filled and dug out, and if it comes
--    back, what feeds it is sealed first.
--  * Floor: the turtle doesn't need one, but a player does.  Every block
--    under the tunnel's bottom row that's a hole (a crevasse, a cave, where
--    floor ore was), a fluid, or something not to stand on (grass, snow,
--    cobwebs, dripstone) is filled with a bulk block; a crevasse across the
--    tunnel gets a bridge.  The turtle tops its stack of bulk up from each
--    home's bulk chest, and fetches more if it runs out mid-crevasse.
--  * Lighting: with torches, it keeps every floor block of the tunnel at
--    block light 2 or more (mobs spawn at 0, since 1.18), using as few as
--    that takes: one in a niche dug into the wall at floor level every
--    19 blocks or so for a 3-wide tunnel (fewer the narrower), on both
--    walls when it's wider than 8.  In the niche the torch is out of the
--    tunnel's way; a niche that opens into a cave gets a bulk block under
--    it to stand the torch on.  A scan's fetch or a vein can still go
--    through a niche, or dig the block a torch rests on: it notes that and
--    puts the torch back afterwards (after the fetch, and at the end of
--    the segment).  Torches are
--    supplies: they move forward with the homes, and it keeps up to 64 on
--    board.  Lighting is optional: with no torches it just keeps mining,
--    and --no-lights turns it off (torches are then just valuables).
--  * Never digs chests, barrels, shulker boxes, spawners or ComputerCraft
--    blocks (other turtles, computers).
--  * Position is saved after every move, so `mine reset` can bring it to
--    its last home (`--home N`: home N; `--to-start`: the start) after a Ctrl+T or a server
--    restart, checking the home's chests are there when it arrives.  It runs under T.run, so a
--    Ctrl+T in the middle of a move or turn waits for it to be saved.
--    `mine reset` checks the heading against the tunnel first, and stops
--    if the way back digs through far more rock than it should.
